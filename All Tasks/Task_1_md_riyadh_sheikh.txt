HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and XML eXtensible Markup Language. They are both markup languages used for different purposes.

Purpose:
HTML is used to structure and display content on the web. It focuses on how data is presented.
XML is designed to store and transport data. It focuses on the structure and meaning of data.

Tags:
HTML has predefined tags with specific meanings and uses.
XML allows custom tags defined by the user, making it more flexible.

Case Sensitivity:
HTML tags are not case-sensitive.
XML tags are case-sensitive.

Syntax:
HTML allows some leniency in its syntax (e.g., unclosed tags).
XML requires strict adherence to syntax rules (e.g., all tags must be properly closed).

Data Presentation:
HTML is mainly concerned with visual presentation.
XML is concerned with data representation and exchange.

Example:
HTML:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>HTML Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is an example of HTML.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Example Image">
  </body>
</html>

XML:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
