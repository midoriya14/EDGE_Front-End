An interface in programming defines the structure or contract that a class or object must adhere to. It specifies the properties and methods an object should have but does not implement them. In JavaScript, interfaces are not built-in features but can be mimicked using TypeScript or through conventions in plain JavaScript.

Here is an example using TypeScript to define and implement an interface:

typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  login(): void;
}

class Admin implements User {
  id: number;
  name: string;

  constructor(id: number, name: string) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
  }

  login() {
    console.log(`${this.name} has logged in.`);
  }
}

const admin = new Admin(1, "John Doe");
admin.login();
